# Drink Reminder Program

A simple drink reminder application built using Python. This program helps you (actually myself) remember to drink water at regular intervals with a hydrated cat.

## Features

- **GIF Reminder**: Displays a fun GIF to remind you to drink water. It automatically closes after 10 seconds or you could close the display yourself. It does NOT close the application.

- **System Tray Icon**: Minimizes to the system tray with an option to quit the application.

- **Customizable Reminder Interval**: Open settings from the system tray and customize the interval for showing the GIF reminder. (Default 1 minute)

## Download

You can download the latest version of the Drink Reminder application from the [Releases page](https://github.com/AkiNotBunny/drink_reminder/releases).
