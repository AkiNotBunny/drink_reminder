# Drink Reminder Program

A simple drink reminder application built using Python. This program helps you (actually myself) remember to drink water at regular intervals with a hydrated cat.

Libraries: Tkinter, Pillow, Pystray, Schedule.

## Features

- **GIF Reminder**: Displays a fun GIF to remind you to drink water. It automatically closes after 10 seconds or you could close the display yourself. It does NOT close the application.

- **System Tray Icon**: Minimizes to the system tray with an option to quit the application.
  
### WIP
- **Customizable Reminder Interval**: Easily adjustable timing for reminders.
